# README
The idea is to reproduce in light version secretsantaorganizer.com
The connected user can create an Event in which he will add emails.
The program will randomly associate one user with another in the idea of ​​having to give him a little gift at the end of the year.
An event therefore has a title, a list (of emails + name), a max amount for the gift.
An email must be sent to the user to see the name of the person.
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
